# timer
Execution timer for measuring elapsed times for code blocks written in C++11

## Installation

`timer` is a header-only, single-file library. It can be used by just copying `timer.hpp` and pasting it into your project.

Alternatively, it can be installed using `cmake`. If your project is also managed using `cmake`, `ExternalProject` commands are useful for including `timer` to your project.
